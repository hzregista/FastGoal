# FastGoal
 
A simple football game designed with canvases, coded with movepaddle and some mathematical calculations. 

The "goal" in this game that played against the computer is to score goals from goal to goal. 

On an area similar to a football field two rackets and a ball that accelerates as it hits the wall...

It is not as easy to play as it seems. it's also a little annoying.
